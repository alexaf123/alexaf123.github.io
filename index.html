        <h2>Research Group News</h2>
	<p><b>January 2024</b>: Welcome undergraduate research assistants Leo Luo and Kyra Schlezinger to the group! Leo will be working with Prof. Anderson-Frey and researchers in Oklahoma on a new database of supercell thunderstorms, and Kyra will be working with Prof. Anderson-Frey and Prof. Lynn McMurdie on a study of high-latitude severe thunderstorms.
        <p><b>December 2023</b>: PhD student Zhanxiang Hua traveled to San Francisco, CA for the AGU Annual Meeting to present his poster entitled "Understanding the clustering of proximity sounding profiles and sounding-derived parameters for near-storm environments". Prof. Anderson-Frey remotely presented her poster entitled "Where'd That Come From? A Deeper Dive into Marginal U.S. Tornado Environments".</p>
	<p><b>November 2023</b>: Prof. Anderson-Frey traveled to the University of Oklahoma to visit with students, federal scientists, and faculty and presented some of her work on tornadoes in unusual environments at a colloquium at the National Weather Center.</p>
	<p><b>September 2023</b>: Welcome new MSc student Miles Epstein to the group! Miles will be working with Prof. Anderson-Frey and collaborators at Central Michigan University on a project using machine learning techniques to track the time evolution of near-storm environments! Welcome also to new undergraduate research assistant Paige Klobucnik, who will be working with Prof. Anderson-Frey and Prof. Lynn McMurdie to create a case study of a major thunderstorm outbreak in the Canadian Arctic! Prof. Anderson-Frey traveled to Iowa State University to meet with professors and students, and gave a seminar featuring work on tornadoes in unusual environments. She also was in attendance at the UCAR Members' Meeting in Boulder, CO.</p>
	<p><b>Summer 2023</b>: PhD student Zhanxiang Hua participated in two highly competitive research internships: the CORE Institute internship at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and an internship at Descartes Lab in Santa Fe. Prof. Anderson-Frey was invited as a keynote speaker to the 11th European Conference on Severe Storms in Bucharest, Romania, and also gave an invited talk at Wageningen University in Wageningen, the Netherlands.</p>
